<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In Southern Europe are a number of comparatively
small countries known as the Balkan
States, which remind one very much of quarrelsome
children whose troubles have to be
straightened out by older brothers and sisters.
Many years ago there were more independent
and partially independent states than now.
Two of these little principalities called Walachia
and Moldavia found that they could better
protect themselves from their neighbors if
they stood together. So they combined under
one government, and the present country of
Roumania was formed in 1857.</p>

<p>In its native form the name of this country
was "Romania," representing the claim of the
inhabitants to descent from the Roman legions
that colonized the country. These colonists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
who called themselves "Romani," or "Rumeni,"
came from the Carpathian lands and
the present Transylvania in the early Middle
Ages.</p>

<p>When once started, Roumania grew quite
strong as a state. The people wanted to learn,
and improve their condition, and there is no
better example of this than their farming, for
this country has become one of the greatest
grain exporting countries in Europe. This was
done, for one thing, by giving up their old-fashioned
wooden plows, which just scratched
the surface of the ground, and using modern
steel plows from other countries which turned
the ground over, just as our plows do.</p>

<p>The Roumanian men and women are strong
and sturdy, and the men are noted for their
bravery and hardiness. So, among the Roumanian
children, we find hardy, manly little
boys and cheerful, if serious-minded, little girls.
However, they like to play, just as do all of
our little foreign cousins. This little book tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
about their everyday games and pastimes, how
they live, and how they dress.</p>

<p>The brave fathers and brothers of our little
Roumanian cousins took their places in the battle
line to defend their homes in the great war
that is now being fought in Europe. No one
knows what the outcome of this terrible struggle
will be. Will Roumania be destroyed, or
will she emerge a greater and more powerful
country, standing for liberty and justice?
Time only will tell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBES</div>


<p>Jonitza lay sprawled out on the warm carpet
in the living-room near a big brick stove that
reached almost to the ceiling. Beside him
were his playthings and two picture books with
fancy covers, but he kicked his slippered feet
discontentedly at them, until his mother, seated
at the other end of the room, arose, put down
her sewing, and with a scarcely audible sigh,
picked them up and laid them on the table.</p>

<p>Jonitza paid no attention. Ever since he
had been seriously ill the month before, he had
grown accustomed to having people wait on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
him. He now turned on his back and began
tracing in the air with his finger the pretty
stenciled patterns that covered the walls.
Tiring of that, he started beating a monotonous
tattoo with one foot, until his mother, with the
faintest shade of impatience, said: "I think
you'd better get up. You've been lying on the
floor for a whole hour doing nothing."</p>

<p>Jonitza arose languidly, stretched himself,
and walking over to one of the big double windows,
plumped himself down into a deep arm
chair in front of it.</p>

<p>Jonitza's home was a very comfortable one-story
house in the city of Galatz, one of the
leading ports on the Danube River, near the
border line between Moldavia and Wallachia,
the two provinces which with Dobrudja, make
up the kingdom of Roumania. It was in one
of the best residence districts, at one end of a
high earth cliff. Somewhat below this cliff
extended the flat level of the Lower Town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
made up principally of mills and business
houses, immense warehouses for grain, much of
which is exported from Roumania, and wharves
stretching out to the river.</p>

<p>The little boy could not see much of this, but
far below, in between the scattered apricot-trees
and lilac bushes in the garden, he could
just get a glimpse of an interesting procession
of rude carts to which bullocks or buffaloes were
harnessed, toiling slowly upward on a wide
road. He had become so interested in the
struggles of one cart that looked as if it were
loaded with the enormous reeds that are used
for fuel by the poorer people of Galatz that he
did not hear the bell ring and so was quite
unprepared to have a hand suddenly laid on
his shoulder and to look up into the smiling face
of the family Doctor.</p>

<p>Jonitza had a guilty feeling without knowing
why and tried his best to scowl and look away.
It wasn't easy though.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why aren't you out-of-doors?" the Doctor
asked in a surprised tone.</p>

<p>It was Jonitza's turn to be surprised.
"Why," he stammered, "it's&mdash;too cold," here
he shivered, "I&mdash;I&mdash;I am not well enough."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" the Doctor said. "The
air is delightful. I've been traveling around
half the day in it. And, even granting that
you're not well&mdash;why, fresh air is the only
thing that will make you well."</p>

<p>Jonitza suppressed a yawn and looked listlessly
about him. The Doctor shrugged his
shoulders as he said: "I see I must leave a
new prescription for you." Saying this, he
tore a leaf from his note-book, hastily wrote
something on it, folded it, and handed it to
Jonitza's mother who stood near by, with:
"Please treat what is written here seriously,
Mrs. Popescu. I shall have more to say
regarding it to your husband. Now I must
hurry away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Popescu barred the entrance.</p>

<p>"Not until you have had some coffee," she
said. At the same moment, a maid entered
with a tray on which were coffee and sweets,
the refreshments usually handed to visitors in
Roumania. The Doctor took a taste of the
coffee and one of the sweetmeats and laughingly
remarked as he left: "It's only fresh
air that keeps <em>me</em> from breaking down under
the régime to which <em>I</em> am subjected."</p>

<p>It was only after the door had closed behind
him that Mrs. Popescu unfolded the paper that
he had given her. As she glanced over it she
gave an exclamation that caused her son to look
up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Come here," she said to him, and, when he
approached, she put her arms around him.
"The Doctor asked this to be taken seriously,
and he has ordered&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jonitza's eyes grew round with something
like terror, as he fixed them on her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's nothing bad. Do look natural," his
mother hastily continued. "He has simply
ordered me&mdash;to take you to spend a month
on a farm near some springs in the foot-hills!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>JONITZA GETS INTERESTED</div>


<p>Evidently the Doctor did see Jonitza's
father, for before the week was ended it had
been definitely decided that as soon as the
weather was a little warmer Mrs. Popescu
would leave with her son for a month's stay in
the country. Jonitza had been a trifle interested
at first, then he had grumbled, and, finally,
he had resumed the languid air that was so
peculiarly trying to those about him.</p>

<p>There was one thing in particular that he
rebelled against even in his languid state and
that was the fact that every afternoon he was
now bundled up and ordered out-of-doors for
an hour.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go," he would say every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
time; and every time his mother would kiss him
and answer sweetly, "It is for your own good.
We must do what the Doctor orders."</p>

<p>Then he would go out into the garden with
its lilac and acacia bushes that were just beginning
to show leaf buds and walk slowly up and
down or stand first on one foot and then on the
other as if unable to decide what to do. But
one day things went differently. Whether it
was due to the air having a genuine spring
flavor for the first time that year, or to the fact
that it was a holiday and he had been left at
home with a couple of servants, or to the fact
that the departure for the foot-hills had been
definitely set for the first day of the following
week, or to some other entirely different cause,
in any case there was quite an alert look about
the boy and even something of a sparkle in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Maritza, the maid, noticed it and remarked
to the cook: "Master Jonitza looks quite spry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to-day. If he were well, I'd warrant he would
get into some mischief." Then she forgot all
about him.</p>

<p>A group of boys that Jonitza knew slightly
passed by and one seeing him called out:
"Come on with us. We're going to the
marsh." To his own surprise, Jonitza called
back, "All right," and joined them.</p>

<p>When they reached a marshy plain bordering
on the Danube some of the boys left them, and
Jonitza found himself alone with two boys, both
younger than himself. All three were tired
from the walk, and finding the stump of an old
tree, sat down on it and amused themselves
counting the ducks that they saw. Suddenly
something that his tutor had told him occurred
to Jonitza. "Do you know," he said, "that
there are more varieties of ducks on the Danube
than in most parts of the world? Let's see
how many different ones we can make out."</p>

<p>The little boys did not take kindly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
suggestion. "I am hungry," one of them said;
"let's go home."</p>

<p>So back the three began to trudge, now and
then throwing a stone into the air, or, when
they could, into the water.</p>

<p>Jonitza felt more tired than he cared to confess
to the two youngsters and inwardly planned
to lie down as soon as he came within doors.
"I'll be home in less than fifteen minutes,
now!" he suddenly exclaimed, thinking aloud.</p>

<p>"How can you and see me dance?" said a
voice behind him so unexpectedly that Jonitza
jumped. Turning, he saw a laughing peasant
all decorated with tiny bells.</p>

<p>"Oh, jolly!" the other boys shouted.
"There's going to be a dance! Come on!"</p>

<p>Those little bells must have said "Come
on" too, for Jonitza found himself trying to
keep up with the peasant's rapid strides.</p>

<p>Down in the Lower Town, before one of the
old domed churches, they found a crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
gathered. Although there was nothing unusual
about such a gathering, one could see from the
faces that something unusual was expected.</p>

<p>It was not a silent expectation, however.
Everywhere people were talking and laughing
and a few young men were even singing. As
soon as the peasant with bells appeared, a shout
arose. At the same instant a troop of other
peasants, all attired in their gay embroidered
national costumes, with bells at their girdles
and on their sleeves, came in a body into the
square, and taking their places began to dance
and shout and sing and stamp their feet. Some
one said this was the Pyrrhic Dance that
was sacred in ancient mythology, and that had
come to the Roumanians from their Roman
forefathers; a dance to prevent Saturn from
hearing the voice of his infant son Jupiter, lest
he devour him. Whether this explained it or
not there was no doubt of the audience liking
it, for at its conclusion all clapped their hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and burst into boisterous exclamations of
delight. Jonitza, feeling some of the excitement,
clapped too, and no longer conscious of
any tired feeling waited until almost every one
had gone before he made his way slowly home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TRIP TO THE COUNTRY</div>


<p>On Tuesday of the following week Jonitza,
his mother, and the maid Maritza, after a short
trip on the train, were being driven over the
vast level and wonderfully fertile plains of
Roumania, that stretched before them like a
great green sea. There were already signs
that the short spring that Roumania has would
soon change into summer. Wild flowers were
to be seen here and there and birds twittered
and flew about.</p>

<p>The way lay among thatched farm-houses
whose gleaming walls showed that they had
been freshly whitewashed at Easter. Now and
then a peasant seated in a rude wagon, drawn
by beautiful, creamy, short-legged oxen with
wide-spreading horns, saluted them gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>At a little elevation in the road they passed
a group of dug-outs called <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">bordei</i>, with turf-covered
roofs and shapeless clay chimneys.
The windows in these <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">bordei</i> were merely
irregular holes in the mud walls. At the door
leading down into one of these primitive houses
stood an attractive looking woman, with a
bright yellow kerchief over her head, and
another around her neck. She was busily
spinning while she crooned a lullaby to a baby
who lay blinking its eyes in an oval wooden box
swinging from the branches of a tree near by.</p>

<p>Not far from these <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">bordei</i> was a cemetery
filled with crosses of the oddest possible shapes.
It really seemed as if the people had tried to
find a new design for each new grave.</p>

<p>They passed wayside crosses also, before
some of which peasants were kneeling in prayer.</p>

<p>But, despite these interesting things, there
was something tiring in the long journey over
the monotonously level plains, and Jonitza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
grew more and more restless. His pretty
mother noticed it and drawing him to her she
began to tell him the most interesting stories.
First of all about Trajan, the great Roman
Emperor, who came to their country so many
centuries ago and conquered the people who
then inhabited it. She described to him the
great column in Rome commemorating his victory,
and told him how proud every Roumanian
was that he was descended from the soldiers
that the Emperor left to guard the new
possessions.</p>

<p>"Is that why we call the thunder Trajan's
voice?" asked Jonitza.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," his mother answered. "We
certainly love to call things by his name."</p>

<p>"The Milky Way is Trajan's Road, isn't
it?" again inquired Jonitza.</p>

<p>His mother nodded.</p>

<p>"The boys call the ditch by the lumber mill
Trajan's Moat," Jonitza continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>His mother smiled. "Roumania is full of
Trajan's moats; it would be hard to find a
village that hasn't one. There are many interesting
stories," continued his mother, "connected
with our history. You know, from your
tutor, that the section of Roumania in which
we live is called Moldavia. Would you like to
hear the old legend as to how it got its name?"</p>

<p>"Please tell it to me," her son answered
eagerly, his eyes sparkling with interest.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," began his mother, "a
Prince called Bogdan lived in this part of the
world. Now, Bogdan had a dog whom he
valued above all the other dogs that he owned.</p>

<p>"One day, while out hunting, this dog, whose
name was Molda, caught sight of a buffalo and
chased it to the very brink of a river. When
the terrified buffalo waded into the water the
dog in his excitement followed, was caught in
the current and drowned.</p>

<p>"When his followers saw how deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
affected by the dog's death Bogdan was, they
pursued the buffalo, killed it, and taking its
head back with them, nailed it over the entrance
to the Palace.</p>

<p>"But this did not lessen the Prince's grief.
Whenever possible he would go to the river's
banks to mourn. The people, seeing him there,
would repeat the story, so that after a while the
river became associated with the name of the
dog and was spoken of as the Moldava.
Gradually the name, slightly modified, was
applied also to all of the surrounding country."</p>

<p>"Please tell me more stories about Moldavia,"
begged Jonitza, when his mother had
been silent for some time.</p>

<p>"Listen then to the story of Movila," again
began his mother, glad to see that the restless
look had left her son's face. "This is a story
of King Stephen who was great in mind but
very small in body. Once in a battle with
Hungarians his horse was killed under him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
As the horse fell, the King was caught by one
of his heralds, a man as large as Stephen was
small. After assisting him to his feet, the
herald offered Stephen his own horse. The
King looked up at the big animal with a frown,
but the herald, kneeling before him, placed
Stephen's foot on his shoulder and exclaimed:
'Oh, Prince, allow me to serve you as a mole-hill.'</p>

<p>"'Mole-hill,' returned Stephen, getting on
the horse, 'I will make a mountain of you.'</p>

<p>"Then Fortune favored Stephen and soon
the victory was his. No sooner was he back in
camp than he sent for the herald. When the
latter came, he found Stephen surrounded by
his court. 'Herald,' said Stephen, 'thou hast
served me as a mole-hill. In return I give thee
the name of Movila (little mountain). Thou
shalt have no other. Thou gavest me thy
horse in my need. In return, I give thee five
full domains over which thou shalt rule.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The carriage here stopped before a tiny
tavern in a little vineyard surrounded town.
They were disappointed in finding that they
could get nothing for lunch except raw onions
with salt and <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">mamaliga</i>, the cold corn meal
mush that is eaten everywhere throughout
peasant Roumania. At first Mrs. Popescu
thought they would eat from their own well-filled
lunch basket, but when Maritza remarked
that <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">mamaliga</i> was really very good, she
changed her mind. Then, as they seated themselves
before a table on the vine-covered
veranda, she asked Maritza to tell them how
the <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">mamaliga</i> is prepared.</p>

<p>"The water must be hot," said the maid,
"before the meal is stirred into it. You continue
stirring until it is almost done, then you
can add a little grated cheese. At our house,
when it is well cooked, we put it into a cloth and
tie it up."</p>

<p>Here some dried fish which the owner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
tavern had perhaps not intended to serve at
first, were laid on the table.</p>

<p>"These fish have a nice flavor," remarked
Mrs. Popescu.</p>

<p>"I know how they also are prepared," said
Maritza, "for my brother has helped get them
ready."</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell us about it, Maritza," said
Mrs. Popescu, evidently not wishing the party
to hurry.</p>

<p>"Very well, ma'am," consented the maid.
"First, a kind of basket work of osiers is built
up. This is covered with walnut leaves in
which the fish are wrapped. The building is
then filled with smoke for several days, or until
the fish look yellow and smell good. They are
then taken down, made into bundles and surrounded
by pine-tree branches, which add a new
flavor to them that most people like."</p>

<p>Here the tavern-keeper again appeared with
a bottle of the damson plum brandy for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Roumania is famous. But Mrs. Popescu shook
her head. "Not this time," she said smiling.</p>

<p>From this little town the journey was a
steady climb upward amid oak, beech and lime-trees.
There were more crosses along the
roadside. In one spot there was a large group
of them, all brightly painted and roofed over.</p>

<p>It was not until late in the afternoon that
they came in sight of the village near which the
farm lay where they were to stay for a while.
Full of expectations of a good supper, they
drove past it and on to a pleasant and prosperous
looking dwelling. In the front of the
broad veranda an interesting group stood waiting
to welcome them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE JOURNEY'S END</div>


<p>The medium-sized, vigorous-looking man
who formed one of the group on the veranda,
hurried forward to meet them. He was dark
with long black wavy hair. He wore white
woolen trousers, a sort of big sleeved tunic or
shirt of coarse but very clean linen, well belted
in at the waist by a broad scarlet woolen scarf.
Over this was a sleeveless sheepskin jacket, the
wool inside, the outside gayly embroidered.
On his feet were goatskin sandals.</p>

<p>His wife was slender and quite fair. Like
her husband, she was evidently wearing a holiday
dress. This was a white gown covered
with red and black embroidery, a brightly
colored apron, and several necklaces of colored
beads and coins. A gay kerchief, fringed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a row of spangles, was set well back on her
light brown hair. She also advanced to meet
the newcomers.</p>

<p>A bright-eyed boy of about twelve and a
very pretty girl about four years younger were
left standing and staring by the doorway.
After greetings had been exchanged and all had
descended from the carriage, the farmer said
something to his son who immediately went up
to Jonitza and offered him his hand. At the
same time he proposed showing him the grounds
while supper was being placed on the table.</p>

<p>Jonitza at once accepted the offer. He was
anxious to see what was outside, and, besides,
his legs felt so stiff from the long ride that he
longed to exercise them.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys spoke at first, although
they glanced shyly at each other now and then.
At a corner of the house the ice was broken in
an unexpected fashion. They walked right
into a flock of geese who set up a "Honk!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Honk!" and made a peck at Jonitza who
happened to disturb them most.</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, Jonitza jumped awkwardly
to one side. Nicolaia, his companion,
could not restrain a laugh. The next minute,
evidently fearing that he had hurt his new
acquaintance's feelings, he put his hand on his
shoulder in a friendly way and suggested a
visit to the pigs.</p>

<p>"Katinka," he called to his sister, who was
shyly following them, "go get something to
take to the pigs."</p>

<p>Katinka turned obediently and ran into the
house. She soon reappeared, carefully holding
a pan.</p>

<p>The pigs proved worth visiting. They were
of the wild boar species with an upright row
of funny hard bristles on their backs. They
were so full of play, too, that Jonitza was genuinely
sorry to hear the call to supper.</p>

<p>"It's just splendid here!" he whispered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
his mother as he saw her for an instant alone
before entering the big kitchen which served
also as dining-room.</p>

<p>Jonitza now noticed that although the farmer
and his son had kept their hats on in the house,
they were careful to remove them before sitting
down to the meal.</p>

<p>This meal was quite an elaborate one. There
was fishroe and olives, mutton and cheese, and
rye bread about two inches thick and pierced all
over with a fork. This was broken, not cut.
There was also a kind of <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">mamaliga</i> cooked in
milk and called <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">balmosch</i>. This was placed on
the table on a big wooden platter, cut with a
string, and eaten with layers of cheese.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GETTING ACQUAINTED</div>


<p>Jonitza and his mother were out early next
morning after a breakfast of bacon and
<i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">mamaliga</i>.</p>

<p>The farm-house at which they were staying
looked attractive in its cleanliness. It had been
recently whitewashed and the doors and window
frames painted a bright blue. It was
built entirely of timber. The roof consisted of
thin strips of wood laid closely row upon row.
Near the house were some fruit-trees and lilac
bushes and a small flower garden in which basil
and gilliflowers, so often mentioned in Roumanian
folk songs, were conspicuous.</p>

<p>Inside, the big living-room had a comfortable,
homey air. The walls were partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
covered with hand-woven tapestries. In one
corner was a huge Dutch looking stove, while
opposite, under an ikon, stood the primitive
loom that is still to be seen in all Roumanian
farm-houses. Besides the table on which the
meals were served, there were some plain three-legged
chairs, a large chest, a smaller table on
which the basket of Easter eggs still stood, and
a sort of couch which served Nicolaia as a bed
at night. Its corn husk mattress had a pretty
cover with an embroidered ruffle over it in the
daytime. The straw pillows then changed
their clothes for more fancy ones and were
placed evenly against the wall.</p>

<p>Jonitza was anxious to show his mother the
sportive pigs and he lost no time in marching
her to them. When she had expressed sufficient
admiration, they wandered to the well
with its long sweep to which a rock was
attached, and crossed themselves before the
brightly painted crosses that were on each side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of it. Katinka came out with a pitcher while
they stood there, and knelt in prayer before the
crosses before drawing up the water.</p>

<p>"Where is Nicolaia?" they asked her. She
pointed to the cow-shed where they found him
hard at work.</p>

<p>He smiled at them in greeting.</p>

<p>"This is my job," he said, "until I take the
sheep to pasture in the mountains, for my
mother is to let me do so this year."</p>

<p>Jonitza watched his robust companion with
some envy as he went cheerfully about what he
had to do. Nicolaia did it all easily and
quickly; at the same time he did not neglect to
make an occasional pleasant remark, and he
did this with the courtesy that seems natural to
the Roumanian peasant. Among other things
he told them the names of some of the beautiful
cream-colored oxen that his father owned.
They were very high-sounding ones. There
were Antony and Cæsar, Cassius and Brutus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Augustus, and, of course, Trajan, the finest-looking
creature of all.</p>

<p>Then, almost without warning, the weather
changed, a heavy rain setting in. This caused
all, except the father who was absent, to gather
in the big living-room. Here Katinka, in a
matter-of-fact way, took out some embroidery
on linen, which at the age of eight she was
already getting ready for her bridal trousseau.
Later she showed Mrs. Popescu a rug that she
was beginning to weave as a covering for her
bed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mrs. Popescu and Maritza
also took out some embroidery, the peasant
mother sat down at the loom, and Nicolaia
brought out a bit of wood-carving. This, he
said, was now being taught in the village school.
Jonitza alone had no work. He stood for a
while by the window watching the rain splash
against it and the wind shake the trees as if it
meant to uproot them. It was not long, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
before he wandered to where Nicolaia
sat and watched him work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Popescu looked over at her idle son
several times. A sudden inspiration made her
say: "You seem to carve very nicely, Nicolaia.
How would you like to be Jonitza's
teacher and earn a little money of your
own?"</p>

<p>"Will you?" asked Jonitza dropping on the
floor beside Nicolaia. The peasant boy looked
up with a pleased smile. "If you think I
know enough," he answered modestly, "I'll be
glad to teach you."</p>

<p>Here his mother could not keep from remarking
with a proud air: "The school
teacher takes an interest in Nicolaia. He has
advised him to attend the Government School
of Fruit Culture which is in the next village
from ours. He says he would learn other
things besides taking care of fruit-trees there.
But that isn't possible, for he's promised as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
apprentice to his uncle in Bukurest. Well,
he'll learn a great deal there, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," exclaimed Nicolaia when his
mother had left the loom and taken up some
knitting, "while we are working won't you sing
some songs as you do when we're alone?"</p>

<p>His mother's fair face flushed as she looked
shyly at Mrs. Popescu. "I must get things
ready for the mid-day meal," she said rising.</p>

<p>As soon as her back was turned, Mrs. Popescu
nodded to good-natured Maritza who understood
and began to sing a song about a
<i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">heiduk</i>, the traditional hero of the Roumanian
peasantry, a person as fascinating as our own
Robin Hood. The song told how handsome
he was, how winning his ways, how fearless his
manner towards tyrants, how kind to the poor
and unfortunate.</p>

<p>Nicolaia's mother was back in her place before
the maid finished. "That was very nice,
dear," she remarked. "And now I can't do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
less than sing a song, too. It'll be about a
woman, the bravest shepherdess that ever was
seen."</p>

<p>This was evidently a favorite with the children,
for they joined in an odd refrain that
occurred every once in a while.</p>

<p>She had scarcely finished when the sun came
out to announce that the rain was over. A moment
after the door opened and her husband
entered.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AN EXCURSION</div>


<p>During the meal that followed, the farmer
turned to his son with: "You will have to go
to the Convent for me this afternoon. I can't
spare the time myself. And perhaps"&mdash;here
he turned to Mrs. Popescu&mdash;"you and your
son might like the trip. It would give you a
chance to see one of our old-time institutions."</p>

<p>Mrs. Popescu thanked him. "Nothing
could be pleasanter," she said.</p>

<p>Soon all three were seated on a rough timber
cart with apparently nothing to hold it together.
To the cart were harnessed two moody looking
buffaloes with horns lying almost flat along their
necks. The cart swayed and twisted up the
rough road when suddenly Nicolaia gave an
excited exclamation. They were just in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
middle of one of the great swollen streams that
flowed everywhere over the mountains.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked Mrs. Popescu
anxiously, for Nicolaia was standing up
and urging the animals forward.</p>

<p>Nicolaia gave a short, funny laugh. "The
buffaloes want to take a bath," he answered,
and again shouted at them. Fortunately, after
a display of much stubbornness on their part,
he did persuade them that neither the time nor
the place was suitable for bathing, and they
moved slowly on.</p>

<p>After safely passing through all the ruts and
bogs, the creaking cart at length stopped before
what was called the "Guest House" on
one side of an old half-deserted convent. A
servant dressed in the national costume, with a
wide hat on his long curling hair, came to meet
them and bid them welcome. Later one of the
inmates, an elderly woman in a loose brown
dress, appeared bringing coffee, preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
fruit, and buffalo milk, which Jonitza thought
had a very peculiar flavor.</p>

<p>After they had partaken of this refreshment
and expressed their appreciation of the courtesy,
and while Nicolaia was busy with his errand,
Mrs. Popescu and Jonitza visited the
church of the Convent and looked at the crude
frescoes of heaven and hell that adorned its
walls. There were many ikons or pictures of
saints about, for Roumania is a Greek Catholic
country like Russia. The large size of the
Convent showed that it must have enjoyed
great prosperity in former times. Now a deep
quiet reigned everywhere.</p>

<p>Nicolaia grew quite talkative on the way
back; he told of the source of one of the streams
that they passed and how difficult it was to get
to it, of a hermit cave in another part of the
mountains in which the bats fly at you when you
enter, and finally, of some of his own immediate
plans. He talked at length about a friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
called Demetrius, who lived on the other side
of the village and whom he planned to see on
the following day, when his own work was done.
"Would you like to visit him with me?" he
asked, turning politely to Jonitza.</p>

<p>"Like!" repeated Jonitza almost rudely.
"Of course."</p>

<p>They were passing through the village at the
time and Mrs. Popescu noticed that on certain
houses a flower was painted. She pointed this
out. "That," explained Nicolaia, "is to let
every one know that a maiden lives there."</p>

<p>A little further on they met a branch entwined
cart. In it sat two girls gayly talking.
One of them called to Nicolaia in passing.</p>

<p>The girls did not look at all alike and Mrs.
Popescu wondered if they were sisters.</p>

<p>"No," said Nicolaia, "they are only <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">surata</i>,
that is, they have adopted each other as sisters.
Any girls can do that if they love each other
enough. I was at the Church when the ceremony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was performed, and saw their feet
chained together in token of the bond. It made
them the same as born sisters. Sometimes a
young man adopts another young man for his
brother in the same way. The priest always
asks them if they are sure of their affection,
for he says the ceremony makes the new relationship
very binding."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ST. GEORGE'S DAY</div>


<p>The next day the boys walked over to the
home of Nicolaia's village friend, Demetrius,
and here a delightful surprise awaited them.
Two young bear cubs trotted like dogs at the
feet of the village boy as he came to meet them.</p>

<p>"Where did you get these?" both boys
shouted with delight.</p>

<p>"From my uncle," returned Demetrius.
"He captured them after their mother had
been killed. At first they had to be fed sheep
milk with a spoon."</p>

<p>As he spoke, one of the little fellows ran up
a tree in the yard and the other began to play
with a young puppy. Soon the boys were trying
to help Demetrius teach them to turn somersaults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and do other tricks. They gave this
up only when they remembered there were
other things to settle before parting. These
things all related to St. George's Day, or, as it
is sometimes called, the "Witch's Sabbath."
This would come the very last of the week.
There were mysteries in regard to the day, for
the boys spoke in whispers while Jonitza was
trying to make one of the bears jump through
a hoop. He was so much interested in the
antics of the little creatures that he paid no attention
until just at leaving he heard something
which made him open his eyes wide. Hidden
treasure was to be found!</p>

<p>On the way home he answered Nicolaia in
monosyllables and looked moody, much to the
latter's surprise. "What's the matter?"
Nicolaia finally asked.</p>

<p>For answer Jonitza glared and then burst
out with: "What have I done that you won't
let me go with you on St. George's Eve?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Nicolaia was taken aback. "You've done
nothing," he made haste to say. "But this
must be kept a secret and your mother wouldn't
like your going."</p>

<p>"I won't tell her," said Jonitza, wincing a
little as he spoke; "that is&mdash;not until&mdash;eh&mdash;I
show her the treasure. Then she won't care."</p>

<p>Nicolaia looked up and down the road as if
trying to find a way out of a difficulty. At last
he said faintly, "Well, all right, if you can
meet us in the yard by the cow-sheds at ten
o'clock."</p>

<p>On the day before the "Witch's Sabbath,"
Jonitza watched Nicolaia's father cut square
blocks of turf and place them before every door
and window of the farm-house and stables.
"Why are you doing that?" he asked. The
farmer smiled at him but did not answer.
Katinka, however, came and whispered that it
was to keep out the witches. She turned from
him to help her father place thorn branches here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and there in the cut turf. Jonitza followed
every act with a fascinated air. "What's that
for?" he asked her. "The witches run when
they see thorns," she explained, smiling at the
thought.</p>

<p>Two of the men who were helping on the
farm at the time, offered to keep watch all night
near the stables lest the witches should charm
the cattle and do them harm. Mrs. Popescu,
who heard them make the offer, asked them if
they really believed in witches.</p>

<p>They looked at her with the air of grown
up children. "If it wasn't witches," said one
with a triumphant air, "what made old Theodoresco's
cow give bloody milk last year for
several months beginning the very next day
after the 'Witch's Sabbath'?" Mrs. Popescu,
seeing that it would be useless to argue the
question, left them.</p>

<p>A half hour later, Nicolaia appeared and
beckoned to Jonitza to follow him indoors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Here he took an earthen jar from a closet.
"What do you think that is?" he asked.</p>

<p>"One of your mother's jars," Jonitza answered.</p>

<p>"No," said Nicolaia without smiling. "Put
your hand inside and see what you find."</p>

<p>Jonitza did so and brought out some ancient
coins dating back to pre-Roman times.</p>

<p>"My father is keeping these for luck. He
found them when he was plowing," said Nicolaia.
"I am showing this to you because
I thought you ought to know that it may
be that kind of treasure that we'll find to-night."</p>

<p>Jonitza had this constantly in mind the rest
of the day. "How wonderful it would be to
find a real treasure," he kept thinking. He
ate little for supper, went to bed at once when
his mother suggested it, and tried very hard
to keep from falling asleep. But alas, despite
his efforts, sleep came and it was a very deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
sleep, so that when he awoke it was bright
morning.</p>

<p>He hurried out, ashamed of himself, and
found his friend looking very drowsy and grinning
in a somewhat downcast way. In answer
to Jonitza's hurried explanations of what had
happened to himself and urgent questions,
Nicolaia said: "It was just after ten o'clock
when we started. I was relieved that you
didn't appear, for I didn't know what might
happen. There was no moon at the time, but
the stars were out, and as we know the hills
well, Demetrius and I had no trouble making
our way over them. We heard all sorts of
strange noises, but we weren't a bit afraid. I
thought we should surely find the treasure.
You see, they say around here that it is easiest
for the one born on a Sunday or at midday; and
Demetrius was born just two minutes after noon
on a Sunday. So that ought to count.</p>

<p>"We spoke only in whispers as we tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
look in every direction at once. Each of us
wanted to be the first to see the blue flame which
shows where the treasure lies hidden. It must
have been past midnight when Demetrius seized
hold of my arm. I felt his hand tremble.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/i063.jpg" width="352" height="500" alt="Two boys standing by fire, someone approaching" />
<div class="caption">'WE STOOD AS IF PARALYZED'"</div>
</div>

<p>"'Do you see that?' he whispered.</p>

<p>"I looked where he pointed and saw in the
distance what really seemed like a tiny fire. It
was not particularly blue but we did not think
of that. I felt for my knife, for it must be
thrown through the flame so that the spirits
who guard the treasure won't harm you.</p>

<p>"'Have you your knife?' I whispered back.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' returned Demetrius. 'I'll throw
first, and if I miss, you throw right after.'
Before this we had not minded anything, but
now as we crept on, we shuddered whenever
we stepped on a dry twig or caused a stone to
roll down hill.</p>

<p>"As we came nearer there was no sign of
flame but there were bright patches on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
ground as if from the remains of a fire. This
could just be seen around a big bowlder where
we stopped for a moment to gain courage for
the final step.</p>

<p>"As we stood there we heard a sound as of
some creature rolling over. Then on the other
side of the big rock, a huge form arose. We
distinctly heard some cuss words and a threat
so terrible that we stood as if paralyzed. Suddenly
the figure began to move, and forgetful
of everything else but our own safety, we ran
down the hillside, stumbling over each other,
now rolling a way, tearing our clothes on thorn
bushes, and generally having a hard time until
we both landed in a brook. We crawled out
very much chilled and stood listening. Everything
about us was quiet, so I don't know
whether we were followed or not. However,
we did not dare return.</p>

<p>"So, of course, we didn't get any treasure.
My father says it was probably some old gypsy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
but I know it was a bad spirit, for as I have
said, it was after midnight, and good spirits
show the flame only till twelve. When it is
seen later, the treasure is guarded by bad
spirits."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CASTLE OF STEPHEN THE GREAT</div>


<p>How quickly the month at the farm-house
passed! Every day there was so much to see
and do, and once in a while there was an excursion
to some place of interest. The furthest
one taken was when Jonitza and Katinka
went with the maid who had accompanied
Jonitza's mother to the country, for a couple
of days' visit to her home in a place called
Niamtz.</p>

<p>The day after they reached the straggling
village, the children were allowed out to play.
They were attracted to a great red earth cliff,
where they began digging tunnels and building
little cave houses. Tiring of that they wandered
up toward the cliff's summit, gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the beautiful wild flowers that they found on
the way, and resting now and then under some
leafy tree. When they reached the top they
both shouted with delight at finding the ruins
of a castle. What a delightful place in which
to play! There were four corner towers,
strong buttresses and battlemented walls, as
well as a large moat all the way around, now
overgrown with trees.</p>

<p>Jonitza, who was blessed with a good memory,
recalled what he had been told about the
place and so hastened to instruct Katinka in his
own fashion, emphasizing every word that he
considered of importance. "This," said he,
in his tutor's manner, "is the old castle celebrated
in many of our songs, of one of our
greatest kings called <i>Stephen the Great</i>.</p>

<p>"One day, Stephen the Great was fighting
the Turks who were <em>winning</em>. He thought it
was no use fighting any longer and made for
home as quickly as he could. He thought <em>his</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<em>mother</em> would be <em>glad</em> he wasn't killed. But
instead of that she met him at the <em>big</em> gate you
see over there, and told him he ought to be
ashamed to <em>give up</em>; that he was fighting to
free his people, and that she wouldn't <em>ever</em> open
the gates to him and his army unless he came
back as <em>victor</em>." (Here Jonitza gave an especial
emphasis to the last word.) "So
Stephen said, 'All right,' and went back. He
met the Turks in a narrow valley and was so
mad that he killed almost every one of them.
He was a very brave man, and I'm going to be
like him."</p>

<p>These last words were hardly spoken when
there was a clap of thunder and flash of lightning,
followed by a sudden heavy downpour of
rain. The children hurried to shelter which
they found in one of the towers.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i071.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="Boy and girl, someone in doorway in background" />
<div class="caption">"IT WAS ONLY MARITZA"</div>
</div>

<p>It was dark there and the wind and rain
threatened to break through the walls. Bat-like
things flew about, and strange noises, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the mournful voices of imprisoned spirits, began
to be heard. Jonitza lost his brave air entirely
as he and his companion crouched side by
side against one of the walls. Suddenly there
was a peculiarly long whistle, probably made
by the wind passing through some crevice.
Katinka gave a little shriek. "It is the
<i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">Stafii</i>," she cried, clinging to her friend.</p>

<p>Jonitza, though trembling, put his arm
around her. He knew very well that she was
referring to harmful elves whom all the Roumanian
country folk believe dwell in ruins and
are always unfriendly to human beings. He
tried to think of something comforting to say,
but at first only managed to clear his throat.
After a bit what he did whisper was: "We
ought to have some milk to give them."
At this Katinka cried more than ever.
"That's what they say, but we haven't any,
we haven't any," she repeated almost in a
shriek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>This was followed by another shriek as a
dark form shut out what little light reached
them. But it was only Maritza, who had come
with a big umbrella to their rescue.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SPINNING BEE</div>


<p>The evening before they left Niamtz, a
crowd of Maritza's girl friends gathered at her
home for a Spinning Bee.</p>

<p>They came with heads uncovered, for only
married women in Roumania wear veils or kerchiefs.
They were all dressed in holiday finery,
with their hair beautifully waved.</p>

<p>At first a merry little maiden with very red
cheeks, and very black eyebrows over sparkling
eyes, and black hair twisted into a double plait,
came in for a good deal of teasing for some
reason or other. She didn't seem to mind it
and her bright answers caused much laughter
and good feeling. Finally she succeeded in
drawing attention from herself by asking a riddle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
This was followed by another and another
until everybody in the room was guessing.</p>

<p>Then Maritza's mother, who had been busy
getting refreshments ready, came in exclaiming,
"Time for work, girls!"</p>

<p>At this there was a general cry of "Maritza!"
"We want Maritza!" "Maritza
must be our leader!"</p>

<p>Maritza stepped forward with some show
of reluctance. "There are better spinners and
better singers than I am," she said modestly.
But the girls, rising quickly, formed a ring
around her, singing in chorus, "It's you we
want."</p>

<p>Then Maritza took her spindle and began to
spin. At the same time she improvised a
strange song all about a mysterious <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">heiduk</i> or
chieftain who passed through their village.
Suddenly she threw her spindle to the black-eyed,
red-cheeked maiden, holding it by a long
thread as she did so. The merry maiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
caught it and was obliged to continue both the
spinning and singing while Maritza pulled out
the flax. This required much dexterity.</p>

<p>When each girl had had her turn, both in
spinning and singing, refreshments were passed
around. There was <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">mamaliga</i>, baked pumpkin,
potatoes, and last of all, plenty of popcorn.</p>

<p>Then, while all seated resumed their work,
one of their number was begged for a story.</p>

<p>She smilingly consented, and told the following
strange and pathetic tale.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Story of a Lilac Tree</span></p>

<p>"This is a story of what once must have
taken place, for if it had never occurred, I would
not now have it to tell.</p>

<p>"In a little valley among the high mountains,
there lived a maiden all alone. She
worked all day at her spinning and weaving and
sang with joy as she worked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"So the years went on, each year adding
loveliness to her face and figure. One day
when out gathering firewood for her small needs
she heard what sounded like a cry of pain.
Making her way into the thicket she found a
man sorely wounded.</p>

<p>"She spoke to him but he had become unconscious,
and, not knowing what else to do,
she took him in her strong arms and carried
him to her hut and laid him on her own bed.
Then she washed out his wounds and tended
him like a sister.</p>

<p>"As soon as he could speak, he tried to express
his gratitude. 'Dear maiden,' he said,
'had it not been for you I should never again
have seen the light of day, and even as it is,
I fear I shall never walk again. For it was no
ordinary mortal by whom I was wounded, but
a demon of some kind who threatened that even
should I survive, all power to move my legs
will have left me. Of what good will life then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
be to me? Trouble yourself no longer, sweet
maiden, to cure me. Rather let my wounds
bleed anew.'</p>

<p>"But the beautiful girl shook her head.
'Why should we believe all that ill?' she said.
'I am skilled in herb lore and shall cure you.'</p>

<p>"For more than a week the man lay in bed
while the girl tended him. And she grew to
love him, he was so patient, so grateful for all
she did. Then, one morning, he looked
brightly at her: 'Lo, I am cured.' And he
sat up in bed. But when he tried to get down
he could not.</p>

<p>"And the next day it was the same and the
next. But the man did not speak of any disappointment.
Instead, he told his nurse
strange stories of the life he had seen, and one
day something that she found hard to bear.
It was of the beautiful woman whom he loved
and would have wed.</p>

<p>"The maiden, though now sad, still tended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
him faithfully, but to no avail. At last, in her
distress, she sought out a witch who was famed
for her wisdom over the whole mountain side.</p>

<p>"'The man is under enchantment,' said the
old woman. 'He knows his cure, but will not
tell it to thee.'</p>

<p>"'Tell me what it is!' exclaimed the maiden.
'I will pay any price for the cure!'</p>

<p>"'Are you sure?' asked the witch with a
disagreeable laugh.</p>

<p>"'I am sure,' answered the maiden.</p>

<p>"'Know then,' said the witch, 'that only a
virgin life like yours can save him. Will you
give your life?'</p>

<p>"The girl looked down in thought. At last
she spoke. 'If it is indeed so, why should I
not? He is strong again and the world has
need of him. He loves another from whom
only bewitchment separates him. The happiness
of two is worth the sacrifice of one. I
will give my life that they may wed.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"The next morning when the man made his
daily trial to arise, he found to his amazement
that he could do so. He looked around for the
maiden, but she was nowhere to be seen. He
waited all day and till the next morning but she
did not come. Then, full of regret, he went
away. Near the threshold of the hut he
stopped to pick a branch of fragrant lilac. As
he did so, the whole bush swayed with delight,
and it seemed to him that a spirit within it
called his name as he turned away."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NEW PLANS</div>


<p>Jonitza tried to forget that the time for leaving
the country was approaching. The month
had meant much to him. It had made a remarkable
change in his appearance. His listless
air had given way to a wide awake interested
look, and his pale cheeks had already
something of a ruddy hue.</p>

<p>Although for her own sake, Mrs. Popescu
longed for a return home, she felt something
like guilt in taking her son back with her.
Every night she gave much thought to the subject
and every night she knelt in prayer before
the ikon that hung in her bedroom, asking that
light be given her as to her duty. Finally, unable
to decide, she wrote a long letter to her
busy husband and begged his advice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of a written answer, her husband
himself arrived. His solution of the difficulty
startled her.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't Jonitza accompany Nicolaia
as a sheep herder into the Carpathians?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," she said, "there are gypsies
there&mdash;and bad shepherds&mdash;and wild animals&mdash;and
the life is too hard."</p>

<p>Her husband made light of all these things.
"I've talked it over," he said, "with the Doctor.
He declares that the only trouble with our
boy is that we've molly-coddled him. He advised
me to trust him to Nicolaia, whose family
he knows. He says that Jonitza is just the age
to enjoy the experience and that he will thank
us all his life for it."</p>

<p>But at first Mrs. Popescu did not agree.
"He has grown much heartier," she said.
"Perhaps he would get along very well at
home now."</p>

<p>So it was not settled until after the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
thing was talked over with the peasant and his
wife and Mrs. Popescu was persuaded that her
son would be in safe hands and that, besides,
the dangers were less than in the city. Then
Katinka was sent to call in the boys who were
busy as usual with some outside work. They
came in with a surprised air, but when all was
explained to them both set up a shout that
echoed from the darkened rafters of the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Popescu laughed with pleasure. "Can
that be really my son?" he said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>IN THE CARPATHIANS</div>


<p>"I feel as free as a bird!" Jonitza could
not help exclaiming when they had actually
started with their flocks for the Carpathian
mountains. Like his friend, he was dressed in
typical shepherd costume, consisting of a coarse
white linen shirt and trousers, a long mantle of
very heavy wool, and a straight round sheepskin
cap. His very shoes were the same, for
the boys had fashioned both pair together.
They were made of pieces of goatskin that had
been soaked in water until soft, gathered into
pleats by means of thongs over the ankles,
while other bits of thong held them securely in
place.</p>

<p>They had a big flock of sheep under their
charge, for besides those belonging to Nicolaia's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
father they were to herd those belonging
to the richest man in that neighborhood.
Besides the sheep, two intelligent wolf dogs belonging
to the neighbor went with them, as well
as a donkey, to be used later to carry the packs
of cheese and milk.</p>

<p>It was high time for the boys to start, for the
other shepherds had gone, and the hot Roumanian
summer was beginning to be felt.</p>

<p>Although Nicolaia had already spent two
summers on the mountains this was the first
time that he was in charge of so large a flock.
In consequence he shared some of Jonitza's excitement.
There was another reason why this
summer might prove a notable one for him. It
was probably his last experience of the kind,
for his parents had decided to have him apprenticed
that autumn to his uncle, a cabinet
maker in the city of Bukurest, and apprenticeships
in Roumania are for six years.</p>

<p>It was a hard climb for the boys. At first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
as they made their way upward they occasionally
passed one-room shanties, each shared by
an entire family and all the domestic animals.
At the last one of these they stopped to ask
for a drink of water. The door was open and
inside they could see the scanty furniture&mdash;a
rude table, a bench, a stove, and a cot covered
with the skins of wild beasts. A fierce looking
man answered their call and handed them
the water with so surly an air that Nicolaia,
who was accustomed to the great hospitality of
the section where he lived, felt a mingling of
amazement and indignation. There was no
garden of any kind around this house, but there
was a wealth of wild flowers. Yellow foxgloves,
gladiolas, and wild honeysuckle seemed
determined to make the place a thing of beauty.</p>

<p>Just at noon, near one of the little streams
that constantly crossed their path, they came
upon a small band of the gypsies that are as
numerous in Roumania as in Hungary. By a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
small fire over which a kettle hung, sat two
women. A short distance from them lay a
dark-skinned lad, with matted hair, while leaning
against a giant beech on the other side, was
a young man playing a weird air that made one
think of a mountain storm, on a crude violin.</p>

<p>From this wayside camp, the path wound
around and around until at last it suddenly
branched into two parts. Nicolaia stopped at
this point perplexed. "I do not remember
this," he said, as he chose the broader looking
of the two roads. Soon, however, he saw the
mistake he made in doing so. What he had
taken for a path was the channel of a mountain
torrent. It ended in a steep abyss, down which
some of the sheep had already scrambled.</p>

<p>The boys spent fully half an hour of the
hardest kind of work before they got these
sheep back. When, shortly after, they came to
a grassy valley, both, panting hard, threw themselves
under a tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is where we'll camp for the night,"
said Nicolaia, "now that we have all the sheep
together." As he spoke, he unpacked the supper
of cold meat, onions, and <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">mamaliga</i> that
they had brought with them. They also helped
themselves to a drink of sheep's milk, which is
richer and thicker than cow's and of quite a different
flavor.</p>

<p>The sun was already low, and when it sank
from sight, darkness followed very soon.
Quickly wrapping themselves in their mantles,
the boys lay down beside their sheep. So
strenuous had the day been, that hardly had
they exchanged a few sentences than both were
fast asleep.</p>

<p>The next day, after an early breakfast, they
were again on their way. The scenery around
was grandly wild. Enormous birch and oak-trees
towered on both sides of the narrow path,
while lime-trees gave forth the honeyed sweetness
of their blossoms. Here and there a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
precipice would yawn on one side of the pathway.
No homes of any kind were to be seen.</p>

<p>The afternoon was far advanced when they
reached another valley which was to form their
headquarters for the summer. Several of the
shepherds who shared this section noted their
arrival and sent a welcome to them on their
<i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">boutchoums</i>, long pipes of cherry wood which
can be heard for a great distance. In the
Middle Ages, Roumanians used the <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">boutchoums</i>
to proclaim war to the troops.</p>

<p>Nicolaia at once led Jonitza to a sort of cave
formed of large, loose stones. "This," he
said, "is the store-house of six or eight of us
who herd in this vicinity."</p>

<p>The next morning the work began in earnest.
Some of it was splendid training. Each day
Nicolaia and Jonitza had to creep along the
crags with the flocks. Sometimes the footing
was very insecure, so it was no wonder that at
the end of the first day Jonitza was covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
with bruises from his many falls. "I'm as stiff
as a board, too," he confided to Nicolaia, as
they lay down near each other to sleep. But,
by the end of the week, the stiffness was entirely
gone, and Jonitza could manage to keep his
footing on the rocks even better than Nicolaia.
By that time, too, he had learned the call that
would make the sheep clinging to the steep
mountainsides stop eating, look up, and then
come scrambling to him.</p>

<p>The donkey had been let loose as soon as the
valley was reached and got into all kinds of
scrapes from his dislike to being alone. Sometimes
when he found that he couldn't follow the
sheep, he would stand on a bowlder and bray
loudly as if proclaiming to an unsympathetic
world his loneliness.</p>

<p>Sometimes the report would spread that wild
animals had been seen prowling near. This
meant extra watchfulness on the part of the
shepherds. But whether there was reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
for any especial alarm or not, every night each
shepherd wrapped himself in his sheepskin or
woolen mantle and lay down by his flock ready
to spring up at the least sign of danger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>IN THE CARPATHIANS (<i>Continued</i>)</div>


<p>Although Jonitza and Nicolaia could not be
constantly together, they tried to share at least
one meal every day. Once at such a time
Jonitza remarked: "How I wish I could get
to the top of that mountain yonder. See what
a queer shape it is! It makes me think of the
picture of a peak called 'La Omu,' the man."</p>

<p>Nicolaia thought that a funny name. "How
did it come to get it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Let me think," replied Jonitza. "Oh, yes,
I remember now what was written about it in
my story book. It said that it had another
name, 'Negoi,' but that most of the country
people preferred 'La Omu' because of its
resemblance to a human figure. When one
came near he could see that this was caused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
a big rock in the center of a mass of others.
According to tradition, a shepherd once lost his
way there and began to curse God for his misfortune.
Suddenly as he was cursing, God
turned him into stone as a warning to others."</p>

<p>"Although that probably isn't 'La Omu,'"
said Nicolaia, "I should like to climb it nevertheless.
Perhaps Vasili would keep an eye on
our sheep for a few hours if we asked him."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Jonitza eagerly.
And he at once ran to a bluff and shouted to
Vasili, who was stationed nearer to them than
any of the other shepherds. Vasili called back
good-naturedly, "Go on. I'll see the sheep
don't wander far." And the boys started.</p>

<p>It took them half an hour to reach the peak.
Gradually, as they ascended it, the pine and fir-trees
dwindled into misshapen goblin-like
bushes, each of which seemed to be hiding
behind one of the great bowlders that were
everywhere so plentiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/i095.jpg" width="349" height="500" alt="two boys and two snakes" />
<div class="caption">"THERE .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. LAY TWO LONG SHINY SNAKES"</div>
</div>

<p>At one point the boys were clambering up a
steep rocky path when suddenly Jonitza gave
a shriek and at the same time jumped high into
the air. Nicolaia, who was a short distance
behind, stopped so suddenly that he almost lost
his balance. There, stretched out between the
two boys, lay two long shiny snakes sunning
themselves and apparently paying no heed to
what had happened.</p>

<p>Nicolaia recovered himself first. He
grasped tight hold of his shepherd staff and
approached. "Pshaw!" he called disdainfully,
to Jonitza on the other side. "They're harmless."
Then jumping without fear over them,
he ran to where his companion, panting hard,
was leaning against a bowlder.</p>


<p>Seeing an open space near, the boys looked
it over carefully and sat down. "It was the
suddenness of seeing the snakes that made me
jump," said Jonitza, apparently feeling that his
natural action needed explanation. At this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Nicolaia chuckled and then began to lecture
Jonitza on the necessity of always keeping
wide awake in the mountains and never allowing
himself to be surprised.</p>

<p>Jonitza did not relish this and interrupted his
companion to ask questions. "How is one to
tell harmless snakes from others? Have you
ever seen snakes just born?"</p>

<p>At this last question, Nicolaia's eyes flashed.
"How I wish I could find a snake's nest!" he
exclaimed. "Don't you know that precious
stones are made from snake saliva? If I found
a snake nest, I'd not run but kill the snakes, and
then I'd be so rich I'd be able to buy a big farm
of my own."</p>

<p>An answering flash came into Jonitza's eyes.
"Let's go hunt for one now," he said, springing
up. Nicolaia rose more slowly. "I'm
willing, but I warn you that we must be careful."</p>

<p>So with their long shepherd staves in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
hands, and keeping watch where they trod, they
began a hunt among the bowlders.</p>

<p>How it might have ended no one can tell, for
they had gone scarcely twenty yards when they
heard a loud cry from down below.</p>

<p>"It must be for us," said Nicolaia, and quite
forgetful of snakes or anything else he led the
way back as fast as he was able.</p>

<p>When they reached the slopes on which their
sheep were grazing, they met a shout of laughter.
"It was your donkey," Vasili explained.
"He tried, as usual, to follow the flock and this
time slipped down between two rocks and
couldn't go forward or back. Didn't you hear
him bray? I didn't know what to do and so
called for you. But in the meantime this other
Vasili here came bounding up from nowhere.
And you ought to have seen him manage! He
tied the donkey's feet together with a thong
and lifted him out as easily as one would a
baby."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know you helped me," said a new
voice.</p>

<p>The boys looked up to see a stranger standing
near. He was of medium height but thickset
and very hardy in appearance. Instead of
a sheepskin cap a broad-brimmed hat was set
well back over a mass of glossy black curls.
His features were regular; his eyes were now
smiling but there were angry lines written long
before around them. The boys shook hands
with him and thanked him. "It was nothing,"
he said. "Aren't we brothers?"</p>

<p>"Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"I belong to the other side," the youth
answered, and then added, "The side that isn't
free."</p>

<p>All knew at once that he referred to Transylvania,
which, although a part of Hungary, is
largely inhabited by Roumanians.</p>

<p>"We intend to make it free," Nicolaia
answered with feeling. The Transylvanian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
smiled and shook his head. Then, without a
word more, he left them.</p>

<p>There was one other shepherd that they
learned to know. He was the oldest there and
came from Jassy, once the capital of Moldavia,
a city so old that the Turks claim that it dates
back to the time of Abraham. The Roumanians,
however, feel that they can do better than
that. They put its foundations to the time of
their beloved Trajan!</p>

<p>This shepherd, of whom later they heard
strange wild tales, kept much to himself.
Often, however, the monotonously melancholy
notes of a wooden flute on which he played
would reach them. Sometimes, too, especially
at early dawn, they would hear him draw forth
powerful notes on the <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">boutchoum</i>, such as no
other shepherd could equal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LEAVING THE MOUNTAINS</div>


<p>Thus the summer slowly passed in healthy
out-of-door life that began to grow exceedingly
monotonous at the end. It was lonely, too, for
after the boys became used to the work even the
noon meals together became rarer, and sometimes
several days passed with no other communication
than a few calls to each other.</p>

<p>At last September came. This is the month
when the herdsmen take their sheep again to the
valleys. The donkey was laden with cheeses
of sheep's milk, and the boys followed the procession
back to the village from which they
had started. They found it delightful to be
together again, and somehow, as they talked it
over, the summer experience that had begun to
be trying regained its charm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>They joked, they told folk tales, and Nicolaia
even sang a ballad that had long been a favorite
with the Roumanians. It was very touching,
and, of course, had to do with a shepherd, of
his love for his sheep and his dogs and his
longing to lie near them even in death.</p>

<p>Long before they reached the farm-house
they had been seen by Katinka who ran out to
meet them.</p>

<p>Jonitza found some letters awaiting him.
He picked out the daintiest, knowing it to be
from his mother, and, begging to be excused,
tore it open to read immediately.</p>

<p>It was from Sinaia, the fashionable mountain
resort where "Carmen Sylva," the late loved
dowager Queen Elizabeth, had had her summer
home.</p>

<p>"Your father," said the letter among other
things, "has to make a business trip among our
Wallachian farmers. He intends to take you
with him and finally spend a day or two with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
me here. Later on, we shall visit relatives for
some time at the capital, Bukurest."</p>

<p>Two days later Mr. Popescu took his son
away.</p>

<p>As Mr. Popescu's business was with the
peasants, most of the trip was made by carriage
through the very rich agricultural sections of
Wallachia. Now they stopped at the farms of
the wealthy, where the very latest in farm
machinery could be seen at work; then at some
of the hundreds of small farms where the
peasants still harvested their grain with the
sickle, and threshed it with the flail. On the
way they passed orchards of damson plum,
from which brandy is made, and vineyards with
their rich yield.</p>

<p>The weather favored them. Only once were
they caught in a storm. The sky directly above
had been monotonously blue for several days
when clouds seemed suddenly to form in all
directions. A wind arose that soon changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
into a tempest, raising enormous clouds of dust.
Angry lightning began to fly across the sky,
while not only the thunder but the storm itself
threatened. Through the dust they could just
make out a tower which showed that they were
near a village. The obedient horses strained
every sinew to reach it and did just manage to
get under cover at a rude inn when enormous
hail stones began to fall.</p>

<p>It proved to be rather an interesting place
where they had secured shelter, for it was not
only an inn but a general store where a little
of everything was kept for sale. As no
especial room was assigned them, Jonitza felt
free to wander about the place. On a sort of
screened back porch he found a woman pickling
whole heads of cabbage, adding corn-meal to
the brine to hasten fermentation. This, when
stuffed with chopped pork, onions and rice,
forms one of the national dishes.</p>

<p>Mr. Popescu smiled at the supper that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
placed before them an hour later. There was,
of course, <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">mamaliga</i> and its string, with a big
pitcher of rich milk, then some salted cheese,
raw onions, and some sun-dried beef that had
been seasoned with spices and garlic when
cooked. The platters, spoons and forks
were of wood, the knives alone being of
steel.</p>

<p>Although the owner of the inn was evidently
pleased at having so much to place before his
guests, he seemed to think that he could do still
better. "One of my pigs," he said, "is to be
killed to-morrow. If you will stay till then I
can offer you something really fine."</p>

<p>Although that might not have been the
reason, Mr. Popescu decided to stay.</p>

<p>"Come," the landlord's wife said to Jonitza
next morning as he sat on the stoop in front of
the inn. In answer to her mysterious beckoning,
Jonitza followed her to the rear. Here
he found a group of men and boys gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
around a big fire from which a very pleasant
odor rose.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Jonitza inquired. The landlady
laughed and then whispered, "The pig
has been killed and we are burning off its hair."</p>

<p>After the meat had been exposed to the heat
for a sufficient length of time, thin slices were
cut off and handed to each person present.
This resulted in loud exclamations from some
of the children whose fingers were burnt and
even louder smacking of lips as the delicious
morsels were tasted.</p>

<p>They left late that afternoon for the next
village, overtaking on the way a party of
reapers with scythes over their shoulders. A
young woman crowned with wheaten ears led
several others, all of whom chanted some
melancholy air about the end of the harvest.</p>

<p>Everywhere they went people sang, the number
of folk songs about soldier life being particularly
noticeable. Many of these songs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
were exceedingly touching; some, however,
were wild in character. All were full of a
spirit of rare bravery and resignation to whatever
fate had in store.</p>

<p>At last among the grand forests near the
Prahova River, the pretty rustic houses of rural
Roumania changed to Swiss looking cottages,
and then to fine brown and red-roofed villas,
hotels and baths. Sinaia had been reached.</p>

<p>A little apart from the villas stood the Royal
Summer Palace, with its tall roofs and glittering
pinnacles.</p>

<p>During the trip they had changed vehicles
and drivers many times, and now a very old
man acted as their coachman. His eyes
sparkled as he pointed out the Château. "I
lived near here," he said, "when this Château
was built for King Carol and Queen Elizabeth,
whom they tell me is now generally called
'Carmen Sylva.' My daughter was better
acquainted with her than I. Might I tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the story, sir? It was not long after the
Château was finished that the King and Queen
drove up to spend a few days here. They had
splendid horses and came fast. My little girl
was playing by the roadside and somehow
frightened the horses for they leaped to one
side. They were brought under control at
once, but the child had been more frightened
than they and cried loudly.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty must have heard her for she
ordered the coachman to stop. When he had
done so, she herself got out and went back to
my little one, whom she comforted in a few
minutes. As she kissed her and put some coins
in her hands, she whispered, 'Be ready to pay
me a visit to-morrow morning. I'll come for
you.'</p>

<p>"We did not think anything of this, but the
next day, sure enough, a carriage came to our
little hut for Florica. You can imagine our
excitement until we had our little one again and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
heard from her the whole story of her visit to
Fairy Land, for that is what the visit to the
Château was to her.</p>

<p>"But I have another and better reason to
bless her Gracious Majesty. My brother, sir,
was blind&mdash;couldn't see a thing, sir&mdash;and
our Queen made him happy, as she did others
like him, in the Asylum for the Blind that she
founded in Bukurest.</p>

<p>"She was always doing good.</p>

<p>"She liked our peasant ways, sir, she did,
and our dress. In the Château she always
wore the national costume and all her maids
had to do so. Deeper in the woods is a
Forester's hut where they tell me she wrote
stories and songs like our own."</p>

<p>As the man chatted they approached a deep-roofed
chalet from which the sound of merry
laughter and conversation was wafted down to
them. Then they stopped before it and the
next moment Jonitza was in his mother's arms.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CAPITAL OF ROUMANIA</div>


<p>Jonitza had not been a week in Bukurest
when he began to wish himself back in the country.
At first there had been much to see, especially
in the fine shops on the beautiful street
called Calea Vittoriei, which extends from one
end of the city to the other. On this street is
also the Royal Palace and most of the theaters.</p>

<p>Jonitza and his parents were staying with
near relatives in one of the many fine residential
sections, where the big stone houses are surrounded
by beautiful gardens.</p>

<p>Although this section was no great distance
from the business center, they never walked to
the latter but either drove or went in the big
touring car belonging to the family.</p>

<p>"People must be very happy in the 'City of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Pleasure,'"&mdash;that is what the word Bukurest
means&mdash;Jonitza said to himself one day as he
watched the very lively crowds on the streets.
He was standing at the time in front of the
splendid show windows of a jewelry store, waiting
for his mother who had gone inside. At
first he had stared at the rich gems through the
glass but the interesting passing crowd had
gradually attracted him; the very fashionable
ladies, some light, some dark, talking so vivaciously,
the priests with their long hair, and,
most of all, the numerous soldiers in the
splendor and variety of their uniforms.</p>

<p>"Jonitza," said his mother when she came
out, "I am going to call on an old-time friend,
and as I know such visits bore you, I shall leave
you on the way to spend an hour at the
National Museum. How will you like that?"</p>

<p>"Very much, dear mother," Jonitza
answered.</p>

<p>So the carriage took them to the big Museum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
building where Jonitza alighted. Indoors he
found much to interest him. He lingered
before the displays of magnificent royal jeweled
collars and crowns, and the specimens of
Roumania's mineral wealth: gold, silver, copper,
rock salt, and others. There were drawings
and paintings, too, to be looked at. He
stood long before one of the latter. It represented
a Roumanian boyard or nobleman of
long ago, dressed in a long, loose, rich costume,
with several jeweled daggers in his embroidered
belt. A crowd of dependents surrounded him,
some bowing low, some kissing his hand, some
trying to get him to listen to the tale that they
had to tell.</p>

<p>Although Jonitza's mother was late in returning
to the Museum, he had still much to see
when she did come. A richly dressed young
woman, who treated Jonitza like an old friend,
was with her.</p>

<p>"It is still early," his mother remarked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
his mystification. And she gave some orders
to the coachman who then drove them past the
"Institution of the Blind," the particular
pride of Queen Elizabeth (Carmen Sylva),
past the University and schools of various
kinds, past a beautiful pure white marble statue
of some <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">voivode</i> or other, and on to the extensive
Garden of Cismegiu; then again to the
Calea Vittoriei, where the carriage stopped
before the renowned restaurant of Capsa.</p>

<p>Here Jonitza's father, who evidently knew
of their coming, was waiting to escort them into
a room with tiled glistening floor, lofty mirrors,
beautiful flowers, and exquisitely neat tables.
The place was crowded to overflowing, but
above the hum of voices could be heard the
fascinating music of a Roumanian Gypsy
band.</p>

<p>Hardly had they entered, than two fashionably
dressed men joined their party. After
considerable banter, the conversation became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
so serious that Jonitza did not understand all of
it. Now and then he caught a quotation that
he had heard before, as, "Leave a Hungarian
to guard the thing that you value most," and
"There is no fruit so bitter as foreigners in
the land."</p>

<p>Everything tasted very good, but Jonitza
would have enjoyed it more had some attention
been paid to him. As it was, he was glad when
the party at last arose and while the rest of
the company went to the theater, he was sent in
the carriage home alone.</p>

<p>At home, he found only servants and so went
at once to the little room that was his own during
his stay at the capital.</p>

<p>Here he threw himself down for awhile in
a big armchair and gave himself up to thoughts
that he had never had before, about Roumania's
past history, about the old-time ballads of
<i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">heiduks</i> and chieftains that he had heard in the
mountains, and about what he had caught in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
conversation at the brilliant restaurant that
night regarding Roumania's future.</p>

<p>Even after he lay down on his bed he could
not but wonder if Roumania was yet to be a
great nation, if Transylvania now belonging to
Hungary, if Bukovina now a part of Austria,
and perhaps Bessarabia, though claimed by
Russia&mdash;all with a large Roumanian population,
would not be restored to her. Finally he
fell into a restless sleep in which he dreamed
that he was already a man and fighting that
those of his own blood might be rescued from
foreign governments who despised them and
tyrannized over them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE NATIONAL DANCE</div>


<p>When Jonitza awoke he found black coffee
and delicious white twists awaiting him. He
dressed quickly that he might be in time for the
hearty breakfast that follows. It was a holiday,
and so later he had a ride behind four
horses abreast with his father, first along the
sluggish Dimbovitza River on which Bukurest
is situated, then into the hills to an old three-towered
Cathedral, one of the very few antiquities
to be seen in Bukurest. From here the
city looked very attractive with its metal plated
steeples and cupolas, its many squares and tree-lined
avenues.</p>

<p>Then the horses carried them still further
away to a neighboring hamlet with its pretty
rustic vine-embowered houses, their dark roofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
forming verandas on which clay benches invited
one to rest. Peasant women drawing water
from wells by the wayside greeted them; children
tending geese and pigs smiled at them, and
a man building a wattled fence invited them into
his little country house all blue and white.</p>

<p>When they reached home and had had
luncheon, Jonitza found that the whole family
but himself had been invited to some entertainment
and that he was to be left with Maritza
and the servants.</p>

<p>He had begun to yawn and to wonder how he
would spend the day, when Maritza solved the
problem for him.</p>

<p>"Your mother said that I might take you to
see the <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">Hora</i> danced," she announced. The
<i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">Hora</i> is the Roumanian national dance.</p>

<p>"Oh, good!" cried Jonitza, throwing a
book that he was holding up to the ceiling and
catching it again.</p>

<p>Soon after, Maritza's brother came for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
sister. He was a rather tall, dark-eyed man
and dressed in spotless white linen trousers
with a ruffle around the ankles and deep pointed
pockets in front, embroidered in red. To be
sure to be on time they started at once, Maritza
laughingly repeating that they "must dance on
Sunday to keep the creak out of their bones on
Monday."</p>

<p>A half hour's walk brought them to a modest
section of Bukurest, where, in a square opposite
a tavern, a host of peasant men and women in
their gayest costumes, were already gathered.
Knowing how eager Maritza was to dance,
Jonitza urged her to leave him on the lawn.
"I shall be all right here under the trees," he
said.</p>

<p>When she consented, he threw himself down
to watch. Soon gypsy musicians seated themselves
on a platform at one edge of the square
and began to play. At once men and maidens
clasped hands and began a swaying motion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
words improvised by certain of the youths who
were in charge of the dance for the day.</p>

<p>Others joined; the ring grew gigantic and
then suddenly broke into two, each part with
its set of leaders, while a shout of pleasurable
excitement rent the air.</p>

<p>Jonitza enjoyed it all for quite a while and
then began to yawn. As he turned to see if he
could find anything else of interest his glance
fell on a boy seated some distance away under
a huge lime-tree. Something about this boy
made Jonitza sit upright. Suddenly he leaped
to his feet, ran wildly forward, and put his
hands over the other boy's eyes.</p>

<p>"Guess," he said in a muffled voice.</p>

<p>In answer the other boy jumped up, over-throwing
Jonitza as he did so. It was
Nicolaia.</p>

<p>For a moment both boys showed considerable
emotion. "When did you come? Are you
going to stay in Bukurest? Where do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
live?" were some of the questions that Jonitza
hurled at his companion.</p>

<p>Nicolaia did his best to answer. "I came
yesterday," he said, "to begin my apprenticeship
with my uncle. Since to-day is Friday
and a holiday, Uncle says that I am not to begin
work till Monday. He wants me to see a little
of the city first."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Jonitza, throwing up
his cap. "Where are you going to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"In the morning I'm going to go to market
with Auntie, so as to know how to buy. I'm to
live with them and shall have to do all sorts of
odd jobs at times."</p>

<p>Jonitza grew thoughtful. "I'll try to see
you there," he said after a pause. "Mother
won't let me go alone anywhere here. I'm such
a lovely child"&mdash;here he grinned&mdash;"she
thinks some one might steal me. But perhaps
I can go with one of the house servants or with
Maritza."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll look for you," said Nicolaia solemnly.
Then he added: "I was so tired of watching
the old dance that I was amusing myself playing
<i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">Arshitza</i>." Here he stooped to pick up a sheep
bone shaped like the figure eight, and some bits
of lead.</p>

<p>"What fun we used to have playing that at
your house," said Jonitza with something like
a sigh. "Let's play it now." Nicolaia
nodded and they settled down for a quiet time
by themselves, each trying in turn to snap as
many of the lead pieces as possible into the
rings.</p>

<p>Later they sharpened a few sticks that they
found and played another game called <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">Tzurka</i>,
not unlike our game of <i>Cat</i>. Then they lay
down side by side on the grass and talked.</p>

<p>All this time the music, singing, and dancing
went on, as if none of those taking part in it
knew what it was to get tired. It was only
with the setting of the sun that it came to a stop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Neither of the boys would have known it, however,
so absorbed were they in a deep discussion,
had not Maritza found them. As she
shook hands with Nicolaia and looked at
Jonitza's animated face she roguishly asked,
"Did you like the dance?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes&mdash;" responded Jonitza quite
unconscious of the twinkle in her eyes. "It
was splendid, wasn't it, Nicolaia? I wish it
could have lasted longer!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AT THE MARKET</div>


<p>It was not until he was alone with his mother
that night that Jonitza mentioned his desire to
see Nicolaia at the market on the morrow.
His mother put her arms around him. "It is
a long time since I've gone to market. Suppose
I go to-morrow morning and take you with
me?"</p>

<p>"How good a mother is," Jonitza thought
as he went to bed, "and how well she understands
a boy."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/i126.jpg" width="349" height="500" alt="two woman walking toward car" />
<div class="caption">"'WILL YOU NOT LET ME TAKE YOU HOME IN THE CAR?'"</div>
</div>

<p>It was delightfully cool next morning when a
touring car took them to what seemed a village
of booths or stalls, presided over by gypsies,
peasants and Jews.</p>

<p>Nicolaia and his aunt were evidently looking
out for them for they came up as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
carriage stopped. Mrs. Popescu gave Nicolaia
a hearty handshake and then turning to his
aunt asked for permission to keep the boy with
them for the rest of the day. The aunt
pointed to a basket over her arm, already filled
with the purchases that she had wished Nicolaia
to help her make, and cheerfully gave her consent.
Then Mrs. Popescu made a gracious
offer. "While the boys are enjoying the
market together, will you not let me take you
home in the car?"</p>

<p>Nicolaia's aunt was evidently surprised and
somewhat embarrassed, but when she saw that
the offer was sincerely meant, climbed in with
her basket, remarking that it was the first time
that she had ever been in "one of those things."</p>

<p>As the car drove off, Jonitza grabbed
Nicolaia's hand and squeezing it, exclaimed:
"Isn't this fine!"</p>

<p>"Bully!" returned Nicolaia. "Let's go
from one end of the market to the other."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>To show how entirely he intended agreeing
with anything that his companion might suggest,
Jonitza, laughing, took hold of Nicolaia's
arm and pulled him rapidly forward. Both
came to a standstill where a heavily bearded
man was measuring out rose leaves to be boiled
into jam. Near him was a stall with the bright
pottery made by the peasants, while across the
lane an old woman offered amulets of various
kinds for sale. "Buy one of these," she urged
the boys as their curious glances fell on her
wares. "If not for yourselves, my dears, then
for your mothers or sisters; what I have will
surely protect them from evil."</p>

<p>The boys paid little attention to her words,
but when she laid an arm on Nicolaia he nudged
Jonitza with his elbow, said a few words in a
low voice and both suddenly darted off, almost
knocking down the boys and girls who were
going in an opposite direction, carefully balancing
stone jars or baskets laden with fruit or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
vegetables on their heads. They stopped
again where food was offered for sale. There
were melons and pumpkins, berries, dried fish,
caviar, poultry, and bread booths, some of
them with women in charge who were knitting
or spinning, while waiting for customers.</p>

<p>"Look who is behind me," Nicolaia called
out suddenly. Jonitza turned hastily and saw
a knife-grinder who, having caught the remark,
made a grimace at the boys. They followed
him to a booth, and after watching him for a
few minutes, made their way to a place near
by where all kinds of birds were for sale. "I
must have one," said Jonitza, but when Nicolaia
could not help him decide whether it should
be a parrot or a canary, he decided to postpone
the purchase until another day.</p>

<p>This bird stall was not far from another
entrance than the one by which they had come.
From it they could see numerous carts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
approaching, some of them drawn by buffaloes,
with peasants seated on the front rails.</p>

<p>As the boys eagerly gazed around for anything
out of the ordinary, the chant of a minstrel
reached them. With difficulty they forced
their way into a crowd gathered around an old,
half-blind man who seemed to be improvising
some fascinating tale of war time deeds accompanying
the half-chanted words to a twanging
on a flute-like instrument called a <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">cobza</i>.
Every once in a while as he stopped the
gathered people would shout their applause.</p>

<p>It was not until he grew tired and signified a
need for rest that the boys left. Right around
the corner they came upon an equal attraction.
It was a sort of "Punch and Judy" show to
see which a trifling fee was demanded. "We
mustn't miss this," Jonitza insisted and led the
way into a structure which was crowded with
children.</p>

<p>As they came out, a bell tolled the hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
The boys stopped to count the strokes. As
they ceased, Nicolaia's face grew serious. It
was half an hour past the time when they were
to meet Mrs. Popescu. What would she say?</p>

<p>But, when they found her, she did not give
them a chance even to offer an excuse. "I
know you're late and deserve a scolding, but
how dare I scold you when I was ten minutes
late myself? I do believe in punctuality, however,
for sometimes time is very precious, and
I'm going to try not to ever have this happen
again. What about yourselves?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll try to keep track of time hereafter,
dear mother," Jonitza answered both
for himself and his friend, at the same time
gratefully, pressing one of her hands under the
laprobe.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GOOD-BY</div>


<p>Winter had fully set in when Jonitza and his
parents returned to their home city of Galatz.
It was intensely cold, for the winds from Russia's
vast steppes meet no hindrance in striking
the great plains along the lower part of the
Danube River. The snow lay heavy on roads
and houses, while sprays of icicles hung low
from the trees and bushes and even from the
noses of toiling cattle. The Danube itself was
frozen and would remain so for at least three
months. Even the Black Sea further away
was ice covered for several miles' distance from
shore.</p>

<p>A warm welcome, however, awaited them
indoors. The tall brick stove threw out great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
heat, and the secure double windows treated
the powerful wind with scorn.</p>

<p>Friends added the warmth of welcome, and
Jonitza was surprised to find how many boys
there were of his own age right in his neighborhood.
He stared at them as if he had never
seen them before and they stared in equal surprise
at him. "The fact is," Mr. Popescu confided
to the Doctor, "we have brought back a
new son."</p>

<p>There was one very bright boy in particular
to whom Jonitza was attracted largely because
of some physical resemblance to Nicolaia, and
this boy's opinion came to have quite an
influence over him. For instance when the
question of resuming his studies under his
former tutor came up, Jonitza objected. "I
want to go to the same school as Dimitri," he
said. Dimitri was the name of his new friend.
"There's a teacher there that knows all sorts
of things. Besides, I want to study and work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
with other boys. How can I tell whether I'm
stupid or dull unless I do?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am bringing up a democrat!"
his father exclaimed half jokingly when he had
given his consent. He had reason to think so
in earnest before the winter was over for his
son took part in all kinds of sports and picked
his associates without regard to the class to
which they belonged. Some of Mrs. Popescu's
relatives and friends did not hesitate to voice
their disapproval. Once they made Mr.
Popescu think that he must interfere, but fortunately
before he did he ran across his friend
the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Your advice has done wonders for our
boy," he said to him, "but&mdash;" and in a
lowered tone he repeated some of the criticisms.</p>

<p>The Doctor gave his cheery laugh. "Let
them criticize," he said. "Be thankful that
your son acts as a normal boy should act; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
he chooses his associates for what they are
worth, not for what they can spend. Take my
word for it," he added impressively, "class
distinctions that have counted so much with
some of us, are going to be abolished in our
country as well as in many another, and that
soon, even if it takes the great war to abolish
them."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i131.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="three boys with something under a sheet" />
<div class="caption">"SOMETHING CAREFULLY COVERED WITH A SHEET WAS CARRIED
MYSTERIOUSLY INTO JONITZA'S ROOM"</div>
</div>

<p>Jonitza had made up his mind that Nicolaia
must spend the Christmas holidays with them,
and Mrs. Popescu was anxious to gratify this
wish. But at first it seemed that this would
be impossible. It was fortunate perhaps that
Mr. Popescu had a business trip to make to
Bukurest and so could use a little of his personal
influence. That this had some weight
was shown when he returned on December 22
accompanied by Nicolaia.</p>

<p>Jonitza had given up all hopes of having his
friend with him and so was doubly pleased.
He resolved to do everything he could to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the time enjoyable for him, and begged Dimitri's
interest and assistance.</p>

<p>"Will your parents let you join me in carol
singing?" was Dimitri's first question.</p>

<p>"Mother will, if Nicolaia would like it,"
replied Jonitza with confidence.</p>

<p>"Then," said Dimitri, "I'll come to
your house this afternoon and we'll plan
things."</p>

<p>When Dimitri came he was told that Mrs.
Popescu had given her consent and the boys
retired to a shed to work secretly at the preparations.
They were evidently quite elaborate,
for Jonitza visited the house for supplies several
times. By supper time something carefully
covered with a sheet was carried mysteriously
into Jonitza's room where a hiding
place was found for it.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve Dimitri was invited over
for supper. Maritza herself prepared a special
dish called <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">turte</i> for the occasion. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
consisted of thin dry wafers of dough covered
with honey.</p>

<p>After the meal the boys hurried to Jonitza's
room. When they came out it was hard to
recognize them. Each had on a mask, a long
gown, and a high hat of colored paper.</p>

<p>Nicolaia held a wooden star adorned with
little bells. The center of this star was a representation
of the manger, and was illuminated
from behind.</p>

<p>They took their stand in the hallway where
they sang Christmas carols, some of which
ended by wishing much prosperity to the household,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"For many years,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For many years."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then Dimitri led the way to other homes,
where he knew they would be welcomed.</p>

<p>Before the Christmas festivities came to an
end, Jonitza and Dimitri planned something far
more elaborate. It was to act out a peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
traditional drama for some of the poorest children
of the town. Mrs. Popescu lent her
assistance and it turned out a great success.</p>

<p>The name of the drama was <i lang="ro" xml:lang="ro">Irozi</i>, showing
that it had something to do with the time of
Herod. There were seven boys besides Jonitza,
Nicolaia and Dimitri who took part in it.
The principal characters were a grumbling
Herod, some Roman officers, and three Magi
in Oriental costumes, a child, a clown, and an
old man.</p>

<p>The plot is quite simple. A Roman officer
brings news to Herod (who was impersonated
by Jonitza), that three men have been caught
going to Bethlehem to adore the new-born
Christ. Entering, they hold a long dialogue
with Herod, who at last orders them to be cast
into prison. They, however, implore God to
punish their persecutor. As they do so, strange
noises are heard. These frighten Herod who
begs forgiveness and lets the men go free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Later a child comes in and prophesies the
future of the Messiah. As the child proceeds,
Herod's rage increases until he strikes the child
dead. At this all present unite in reproaches
until Herod sinks to his knees and implores
forgiveness.</p>

<p>The success of the play was largely due to
two characters whose antics pleased the little
ones. One of these was the clown (Nicolaia)
and the other was an old man who was in everybody's
way (Dimitri). This latter had a mask
with a long beard on his face, a hunched back,
and wore heavy boots and a sheepskin mantle
with the wool on the outside.</p>

<p>When the much applauded play came to an
end, refreshments were passed around and
afterwards the children sent home with their
hands filled with gifts of various kinds.</p>

<p>In such gayeties the holidays soon passed.
On the very last day of the year Nicolaia left
for home, and as Jonitza and Dimitri saw him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to the train they anticipated the New Year by
throwing grains of corn at him and repeating
the old time Roumanian greeting:</p>

<p>"May you live and flourish like the trees of
the garden and be blessed like them with all
things plentiful."</p>
